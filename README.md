BuckyPlatformer
===============

BuckyPlatformer is a project I've been working on since November of 2012, and this is the latest rewrite.
After finally figuring out what I was doing last time around, I decided it was time to rewrite the code
so that it ceased to suck (or suck less, anyhow.) A lot of the work I'm doing in this game is being done
in a way so as to make the code modular and reusable. By the end of this project, I intend on making this
into its own game engine.

A sometimes-updated version of the game can be played at
